# LiveXMLEdit 

LiveXMLEdit is a tool for inline editing of XML files. It renders the uploaded XML 
file and lets you create and delete nodes and attributes, as well as update their 
values by clicking on them directly. If you don't see a dedicated save (Submit) button, 
use the ENTER key to save. Once you are done editing the file, you can generate the 
new version and save it.
